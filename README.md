# This Dragon Still Owes Me Ice Cream! Remy Edition

Massive shoutout to EvilChaosKnight for their amazing character images of Amely, backgrounds, and impressive extra text UI element. This mod wouldn't be possible without their work.

Right now this mod is INCOMPLETE. I'm almost done, though

Why did I even do this in the first place/what gave me inspiration?
- This was my inspiration: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=857686289

- Immense boredom when I was cut off from the world for a week was my motivation

- I thought this would be a nice, small, and easy intro mod. 30k+ word script and here we are now I guess

 _______________________________________________________________________________________________

 Thoughts on current version:

 - The most recent version of this mod introduces the orphanage minigame. This minigame is probably not as good as Katsuharu's, but I still like it. It's much more technical and required a lot more assets.

 - I would say that there are probably a fair amount of bugs or discontinuities in the text in the game. Please let me know (Eval#4270 on discord)

 - The next update is going to get me much closer to the end of this mod. I have been thinking about the Remy hatchlings mod, and with how I want this mod to end, I'm not sure if it will work.

 Requirements: (Note that this mod starts at the end of Remy's default good ending.)
 
 - Save Katsuharu's business - This needs to be done each playthrough
 
 - Get Remy's good ending

 - (For a third ending) Complete Adine's good ending at least once before
 
 ________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Extra Content:
 
 Currently, this is a list of tasks you can complete to get minor (or pretty big) changes in the mod: ("+"s signals the amount of extra content). None are actually required to get every ending, but they add a lot of fun stuff that I wouldn't want to miss.

- Sit on the bench in Tatsu Park ++

- Kiss Remy +++

- Get Adine's good ending ++++

- Do some of ECK's Savior mod +

- Have the special at the diner during chapter 1 +

- Talk to Ophelia in the supermarket ++

- Talk to Kevin +

What am I working on now?

- My main priority is getting all of the content finished. I have a set end goal in mind, and I need to get there before going back and polishing everything

- I know many of the transitions are extremely ugly. I'm working to fix that.

- Grammar. I've gone through a lot of it, but there's still probably a ton I'm missing.

- Adding endings. They exist, but there isn't a tangible way to determine if you've seen one.

-Adding achievements. I might do this if I feel like it. I have a few ideas

 Feedback:

 - If you have any feedback whatsoever, please hit me up on discord (Eval#4270). This is especially true for writing, since I know a lot of it is just "OK".

  ________________________________________________________________________________________________

 Conflicts:

 - This mod conflicts with the Remy Hatchlings mod. Sorry :/

  How do I get the most out of the mod?

  - When given the option to go with certain characters. Choose the least amount of characters to the most. It's better, I promise. Endings go from least content/branches to most depending on characters.

  - Only the dialogue options that are really mean will end in a quick game over. Each one IS unique, however, so if you do decide to end it early, at least you get new content each time.

  - Do the extra content listed above

SPOILERS AHEAD!!! BE WARNED.

  Tips for Katsuharu's minigame:

  - If a character says they are in a hurry or seem annoyed, they most likely want their ice cream fast

  - If a character says they don't mind waiting, or ask for extra care for their ice cream, they most likely want you to take your time

  - If a character mentions their stomach at all, they want extra ice cream

  - It's all randomized each playthrough, so the only way you can find a "guide" is looking through the code

  - There's actually a few pretty funny secrets hidden in the game. Probably difficult to get them by chance, though.
    
    - The biggest of these is probably Ophinia's. To get this, have her want the large ice cream, but don't give it to her. RNG based, I know, but it's the only way it makes sense.

 Tips for the orphanage minigame:

 - For the first part of the game, always have Remy sent off gathering items

 - While Remy is gathering items, work on tasks you are able to do (obviously)

 - There are 2 unnecessary red herring items. The large spare parts and the spare lightswitch.
