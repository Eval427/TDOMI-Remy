# TMOMI Remy - Part 1

AKA This Man (Or Dragon) Owes me Ice Cream! Remy Edition

Right now this mod is INCOMPLETE (and probably pretty cringy)

My first attempt at creating a mod for AWSW even though the game came out like 5 years ago. This entire things was inspired by a single steam community post (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=857686289) and an unbelievable amount of boredom. At first, this was supposed to be a quick and simple mod that gave each character a little bit of extra content after their good ending.
 But then I started working on Remy's ending first, and things got out of control.

 Requirements:
 
 Help Katsuharu at least once (no need to for each playthrough although I might add this as a requirement later)
 
 Get Remy's good ending

 Extra Content:
 
 Currently, this is a list of tasks you can complete to get minor (or pretty big) changes in the mod:

Sit on the bench in Tatsu Park

Kiss Remy

Get Adine's good ending

Do some of ECK's Savior mod

Have the special at the diner during chapter 1 (currently not working I think)

What am I working on now?

I know many of the transitions are extremely ugly. I'm working to fix that.

The music choice isn't that great IMO. Would like some feedback.

Grammar. I've gone through a lot of it, but there's still probably a ton I'm missing.

Adding endings. They exist, but there isn't a tangible way to determine if you've seen one.
