# TMOMI-PT1

Right now this mod is INCOMPLETE (and probably pretty cringy)

My first attempt at creating a mod for AWSW even though the game came out like 5 years ago. This entire things was inspired by a single steam community post (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=857686289). At first, this was supposed to be a quick and simple mod that gave each character a little bit of extra content after their good ending.
 But then I started working on Remy's ending first, and things got out of control.
 
 _______________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Requirements:
 
 Help Katsuharu at least once (no need to for each playthrough although I might add this as a requirement later)
 
 Get Remy's good ending
 
 ________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Extra Content:
 
 Currently, this is a list of tasks you can complete to get minor (or pretty big) changes in the mod:

Sit on the bench in Tatsu Park

Kiss Remy

Get Adine's good ending

Do some of ECK's Savior mod

Have the special at the diner during chapter 1 (currently not working I think)
