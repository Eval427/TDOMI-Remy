# TMOMI Remy - Part 1

AKA This Man (Or Dragon) Owes me Ice Cream! Remy Edition

Right now this mod is INCOMPLETE (and probably pretty cringy). I'm working on a major update that should just about finish up all the current endings. I was recommended to tie my mod in with https://github.com/AWSW-Modding/AWSW-Modtools/tree/mod-remy_hatchlings which I'll try getting to.

My first attempt at creating a mod for AWSW even though the game came out like 5 years ago. This entire things was inspired by a single steam community post (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=857686289) and an unbelievable amount of boredom. At first, this was supposed to be a quick and simple mod that gave each character a little bit of extra content after their good ending.
 But then I started working on Remy's ending first, and things got out of control.
 
 _______________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Requirements:
 
 - Help Katsuharu (in each playthrough you want the ending)
 
 - Get Remy's good ending

 - Have Adine's status be either "good" or "impressed" (not required for every ending, just one)
 
 ________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Extra Content:
 
 Currently, this is a list of tasks you can complete to get minor (or pretty big) changes in the mod: ("+"s signals the amount of extra content)

- Sit on the bench in Tatsu Park ++

- Kiss Remy +++

- Get Adine's good ending ++++

- Do some of ECK's Savior mod +

- Have the special at the diner during chapter 1 +

- Talk to Ophelia in the supermarket ++

What am I working on now?

- I know many of the transitions are extremely ugly. I'm working to fix that.

- The music choice isn't that great IMO. Would like some feedback.

- Grammar. I've gone through a lot of it, but there's still probably a ton I'm missing.

- Adding endings. They exist, but there isn't a tangible way to determine if you've seen one.

 Feedback:

 - If you have any feedback whatsoever, please hit me up on discord (Eval#4270). This is especially true for writing, since I know a lot of it is just "OK".

  SPOILERS AHEAD!!! BE WARNED.

  How do I get the most out of the mod?

  - When given the option to go with certain characters. Choose the least amount of characters to the most. It's better, I promise. Endings go from least content/branches to most depending on characters.

  - Only the dialogue options that are really mean will end in a quick game over. Each one IS unique, however, so if you do decide to end it early, at least you get new content each time.

  - Do the extra content listed above



  Tips for Katsuharu's minigame:

  - If a character says they are in a hurry or seem annoyed, they most likely want their ice cream fast

  - If a character says they don't mind waiting, or ask for extra care for their ice cream, they most likely want you to take your time

  - If a character mentions their stomach at all, they want extra ice cream

  - It's all randomized each playthrough, so the only way you can find a "guide" is looking through the code

  - There's actually a few pretty funny secrets hidden in the game. Probably difficult to get them by chance, though.
    
    - The biggest of these is probably Ophinia's. To get this, have her want the large ice cream, but don't give it to her.
