# This Dragon Still Owes Me Ice Cream! Remy Edition

Massive shoutout to EvilChaosKnight for their amazing character images of Amely, backgrounds, and impressive extra text UI element. This mod wouldn't be possible without their work.

Right now this mod is COMPLETE. I updated this README so late though. Whoops!

Why did I even do this in the first place/what gave me inspiration?
- This was my inspiration: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=857686289

- Immense boredom when I was cut off from the world for a week was my motivation

- I thought this would be a nice, small, and easy intro mod. 30k+ word script and here we are now I guess

 _______________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Requirements: (Note that this mod starts at the end of Remy's default good ending.)
 
 - Save Katsuharu's business - This needs to be done each playthrough
 
 - Get Remy's good ending

 - (For a third ending) Complete Adine's good ending at least once before
 
 ________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Extra Content:
 
 Currently, this is a list of tasks you can complete to get minor (or pretty big) changes in the mod: ("+"s signals the amount of extra content). None are actually required to get every ending, but they add a lot of fun stuff that I wouldn't want to miss.

- Sit on the bench in Tatsu Park ++

- Kiss Remy +++

- Get Adine's good ending ++++

- Do some of ECK's Savior mod +

- Have the special at the diner during chapter 1 +

- Talk to Ophelia in the supermarket ++

- Talk to Kevin +
