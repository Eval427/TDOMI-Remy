# This Man (Dragon) Still Owes Me Ice Cream! Remy Edition

Massive shoutout to EvilChaosKnight for his amazing character images of Amely, backgrounds, and impressive extra text UI element. This mod wouldn't be possible without his work

It is very possible that I will upload a video on getting the "perfect" save so you get maximum content out of this mod (basically just going through the extra content steps listed below)

Right now this mod is INCOMPLETE (and probably pretty cringy). I was recommended to tie my mod in with https://github.com/AWSW-Modding/AWSW-Modtools/tree/mod-remy_hatchlings which I'll try getting to.

My first attempt at creating a mod for AWSW even though the game came out like 5 years ago. This entire things was inspired by a single steam community post (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=857686289) and an unbelievable amount of boredom. At first, this was supposed to be a quick and simple mod that gave each character a little bit of extra content after their good ending.
 But then I started working on Remy's ending first, and things got out of control.
 
 _______________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Requirements:
 
 - Help Katsuharu (in each playthrough you want the ending)
 
 - Get Remy's good ending

 - Complete Adine's good ending at least once before
 
 ________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Extra Content:
 
 Currently, this is a list of tasks you can complete to get minor (or pretty big) changes in the mod: ("+"s signals the amount of extra content)

- Sit on the bench in Tatsu Park ++

- Kiss Remy +++

- Get Adine's good ending ++++

- Do some of ECK's Savior mod +

- Have the special at the diner during chapter 1 +

- Talk to Ophelia in the supermarket ++

- Talk to Kevin +

What am I working on now?

- My main priority is getting all of the content finished. I have a set end goal in mind, and I need to get there before going back and polishing everything

- I know many of the transitions are extremely ugly. I'm working to fix that.

- The music choice isn't that great IMO. Would like some feedback.

- Grammar. I've gone through a lot of it, but there's still probably a ton I'm missing.

- Adding endings. They exist, but there isn't a tangible way to determine if you've seen one.

 Feedback:

 - If you have any feedback whatsoever, please hit me up on discord (Eval#4270). This is especially true for writing, since I know a lot of it is just "OK".

 Conflicts:

 - This mod conflicts with the side images mod. This is not my fault, but rather a typo in the other mod's code that makes Lucius crash your game

  SPOILERS AHEAD!!! BE WARNED.

  How do I get the most out of the mod?

  - When given the option to go with certain characters. Choose the least amount of characters to the most. It's better, I promise. Endings go from least content/branches to most depending on characters.

  - Only the dialogue options that are really mean will end in a quick game over. Each one IS unique, however, so if you do decide to end it early, at least you get new content each time.

  - Do the extra content listed above



  Tips for Katsuharu's minigame:

  - If a character says they are in a hurry or seem annoyed, they most likely want their ice cream fast

  - If a character says they don't mind waiting, or ask for extra care for their ice cream, they most likely want you to take your time

  - If a character mentions their stomach at all, they want extra ice cream

  - It's all randomized each playthrough, so the only way you can find a "guide" is looking through the code

  - There's actually a few pretty funny secrets hidden in the game. Probably difficult to get them by chance, though.
    
    - The biggest of these is probably Ophinia's. To get this, have her want the large ice cream, but don't give it to her.
